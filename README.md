Hi there! My name is Shawn, and I'm a full-stack web developer. Thanks for coming to my github!  This github shows the journey of my formal education in full stack web development!

  * I currently work with and enjoy the PERN stack.
  * I am passionate about learning new languages and techniques to better fill my lexicon. 
  * I currently work at Gulfstream Aerospace, but am looking to change careers to one that better suits my passion.
  * I love learning, and will pick up any subject offered with the intent to master. 
  
  Should you need to contact me for whatever reason, please feel free to reach out to me at ShawnBatson84@gmail.com!
  
  Have a good day!
